## Hardware used
â€¢ ESP01  
â€¢ ESP32  
â€¢ LM2596  
â€¢ 18650 (x2)  

## Final toughts

A lot can be improved since we are only using a few at commands and encapsulating them all in one class. A few solid principles could be improved but I'm focusing on getting the main file as simple as possible and not having more than the required class.
